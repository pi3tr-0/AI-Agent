The tech giant invested in Lumotive, a startup specializing in programmable optics for autonomous vehicles and data centers, signaling its commitment to next-gen infrastructure. It also acquired Bee, a company behind a $50 AI-powered wristband that transcribes conversations in real time and functions as a personal assistantâ€”potentially adding a new dimension to Amazon's Alexa ecosystem, with strong privacy protections in place. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services trimmed its workforce by several hundred roles, mainly in senior and specialist teams, as it pivots toward AI-driven operations. On the political front, former CEO Jeff Bezos reportedly met with Donald Trump, potentially clearing the way for renewed support of Bezos's space venture, Blue Origin, in the wake of Elon Musk's waning influence with the administration." # Example internet search result
