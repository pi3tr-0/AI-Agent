While growth moderated compared to Q1, results were broadly in line with expectations and reflected the strength of Apple's ecosystem-led strategy. Margins remained robust, with operating margin holding steady at 28.4%. EPS grew +6.4% YoY, buoyed by Apple's continued buyback program and rising Services profitability. Both top-line and bottom-line performance highlighted Apple's ability to scale earnings in a slower macro environment.",

While several key profitability metrics like basic EPS, net income, and profit margin remained stable compared to historical averages, significant concerns arise from the trend analysis. Revenue growth and total revenue were both lower than expected, signaling a slowdown in top-line expansion.

This suggests potential challenges in both sales generation and cost management.",
